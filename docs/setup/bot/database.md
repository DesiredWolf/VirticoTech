This guide is the next part after [installing the system](/setup/bot/setup). If you have not installed the system yet please do so before continuing.

!!! warning

    The bot was developed and tested on MariaDB (MySQL) and in our current state of development we have not tested any other databases yet. If you have any issues with other databases please let us know in our Discord server.

After you have choosen the database type you are going to use, make the connector string and save it for later. You will need it in the next step. [Get help with connection strings]
